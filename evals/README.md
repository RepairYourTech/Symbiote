## Disclaimer

**Symbiote is a fork of [Roo Code](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code)**, developed independently. While we maintain the core functionality, we've made significant changes, including the complete removal of telemetry and rebranding. We are grateful to the Roo Code team for their excellent work on the original project.
