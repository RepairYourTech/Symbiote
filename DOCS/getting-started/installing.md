# Installing Symbiote

Symbiote is a VS Code extension that brings AI-powered coding assistance directly to your editor. Install using one of these methods:

1. **VS Code Marketplace (Recommended)** - fastest method for standard VS Code and Cursor users
2. **Open VSX Registry** - for VS Code-compatible editors like VSCodium

## VS Code Marketplace

1. Open VS Code
2. Access Extensions: Click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS)
3. Search for "Symbiote"
4. Select "Symbiote" by RepairYourTech and click **Install**
5. Reload VS Code if prompted

After installation, find the Symbiote icon in the Activity Bar to open the Symbiote panel.

## Open VSX Registry

For VS Code-compatible editors without Marketplace access (like VSCodium and Windsurf):

1. Open your editor
2. Access the Extensions view
3. Search for "Symbiote"
4. Select "Symbiote" by RepairYourTech and click **Install**
5. Reload if prompted

## Manual Installation from VSIX

   * Download the `.vsix` file from the latest release
2. **Install in VS Code:**
   * Open VS Code
   * Access Extensions view
